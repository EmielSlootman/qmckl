# QMCkl: Quantum Monte Carlo Kernel Library

![Build Status](https://github.com/TREX-CoE/qmckl/workflows/test-build/badge.svg?branch=main)

The domain of quantum chemistry needs a library in which the main
kernels of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are implemented. In the
library proposed in this project, we expose the main algorithms in a
simple language and provide a standard API and tests to enable the
development of high-performance QMCkl implementations taking
advantage of modern hardware.

See the [source code](https://github.com/TREX-CoE/qmckl/tree/main/src)
to read the documentation.


To clone the repository, use:
```
git clone https://github.com/TREX-CoE/qmckl.git
```

# Installation

The simplest way to obtain the source files of QMCkl is to download a source
distribution. This particular repository is for maintainers, who write the kernels
in org-mode files and produce the source code and the documentation from these files.

## For maintainers

```
./autogen.sh
QMCKL_DEVEL=1 ./configure --prefix=$PWD/_install --enable-silent-rules --enable-maintainer-mode

make
make check
```

## For users

Obtain a source distribution and run

```
./configure 
make
make check
sudo make install
sudo make installcheck
```

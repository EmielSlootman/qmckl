![Build Status](https://github.com/TREX-CoE/qmckl/workflows/test-build/badge.svg?branch=master)

The domain of quantum chemistry needs a library in which the main
kernels of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are implemented. In the
library proposed in this project, we expose the main algorithms in a
simple language and provide a standard API and tests to enable the
development of high-performance QMCkl implementations taking
advantage of modern hardware.

See the [source code](https://github.com/TREX-CoE/qmckl/blob/master/org/qmckl.org)
to read the documentation.


To clone the repository, use:
```
git clone https://github.com/TREX-CoE/qmckl.git
```

# Installation

The simplest way to obtain the source files of QMCkl is to download a source
distribution. This particular repository is for maintainers, who write the kernels
in org-mode files and produce the source code and the documentation from these files.

## For maintainers

```
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=$PWD/_install

make
make check
```

A good practice is to make out-of-source builds, because you can easily find
out what files have been produced by the build system, and you can also work
with differently configured versions of the library at the same time.

For example, you can create a debug build compiled with gcc, and a fast build
compiled with Intel compilers:

```
./autogen.sh

mkdir -p _build_gcc_debug/_install
cd _build_gcc_debug
../configure --enable-debug --prefix=$PWD/_install
make -j
make -j check

cd ..
mkdir -p _build_intel_fast/_install
cd _build_intel_fast
../configure --prefix=$PWD/_install --enable-hpc --with-icc --with-ifort 
make -j
make -j check
```

## For users

Obtain a source distribution.

To build the documentation version:

```
./configure
```

To build an optimized version with Intel compilers:
```
./configure \
   --with-icc \
   --with-ifort \
   --enable-hpc 
```

To build an optimized version with GCC:
```
./configure \
  CC=gcc \
  CFLAGS="-g -O2 -march=native  -flto -fno-trapping-math -fno-math-errno -ftree-vectorize" \
  FC=gfortran \
  FCFLAGS="-g -O2 -march=native  -flto -ftree-vectorize" \
  --enable-hpc 
```


Then, compile with:
```
make -j
make -j check
sudo make install
sudo make installcheck
```

## Python API

- [SWIG](https://www.swig.org) (>= 4.0) is required to build the Python API for maintainers

In order to install the `qmckl` Python package, first install the shared C library 
`libqmckl` following the installation guide above and then run the following command:
```
make python-install
```

To test the installation, run
```
make python-test
```

Minimal example demonstrating the use of the `qmckl` Python API can be found in the
[test_api.py](https://github.com/TREX-CoE/qmckl/blob/master/python/test/test_api.py) file.

We highly recommend to use 
[virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) 
to avoid compatibility issues and to improve reproducibility.

## Installation procedure for Guix users

QMCkl can be installed with the [GNU Guix](https://guix.gnu.org) functional package manager.
The [qmckl.scm](https://github.com/TREX-CoE/qmckl/blob/master/tools/qmckl.scm)
Schema file contains the manifest specification for the `qmckl` installations.
It can be installed within the selected `$GUIX_PROFILE` as follows:

```
guix package \
	--profile=$GUIX_PROFILE 		\
	--load-path=<path_to_trexio_scm> 	\
	--cores=<n_cores>			\
	--install-from-file=qmckl.scm
```

where `<path_to_trexio_scm>` should point to a folder, which contains the TREXIO manifest file
[trexio.scm](https://github.com/TREX-CoE/trexio/blob/master/tools/trexio.scm)
(e.g. `~/trexio/tools/` if TREXIO repository was cloned under $HOME).

Installation procedures for both development version (`qmckl-dev`) 
and stable releases (`qmckl-hpc`) are provided.
One can switch between them using the return value (last line) 
in the `qmckl.scm` file.


## Linking to your program

The `make install` command takes care of installing the QMCkl shared library on the user machine.
Once installed, add `-lqmckl` to the list of compiler options.

In some cases (e.g. when using custom `prefix` during configuration), the QMCkl library might end up installed in a directory, which is absent in the default `$LIBRARY_PATH`.
In order to link the program against QMCkl, the search paths can be modified as follows:

`export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:<path_to_qmckl>/lib`

(same holds for `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`). The `<path_to_qmckl>` has to be replaced with the prefix used during the installation.

If your project relies on the CMake build system, feel free to use the
[FindQMCKL.cmake](https://github.com/TREX-CoE/qmckl/blob/master/cmake/FindQMCKL.cmake)
module to find and link the QMCkl library automatically.


## Verificarlo CI

Since Verificarlo should not be a dependency of QMCkl, all Verificarlo
functions are called only when the support is explicitely enabled (and ignored
by the preprocessor otherwise). To enable vfc_ci support, the library should be
configured with the following command :

```
./configure \
  CC="verificarlo-f" \
  FC="verificarlo-f" \
  --prefix=$PWD/_install \
  --enable-vfc_ci \
  --host=x86_64 \
```

where CC and FC are set to verificarlo-f, and support is explicitely enabled
with the --enable-vfc_ci flag. Configuring the library with the "standard"
command will cause all calls to Verificarlo related functions to be ignored,
and the library will be built as usual.

* Set up CI on Travis
* Write tests

* malloc/free : Parameters for accelerators?
We should define qmckl_malloc and qmckl_free just to give the
possibility of the HPC implementations to define how they allocate the
memory (on CPU or GPU, using alternatives to malloc/free, etc).
A possibility could be to pass the id of a NUMA domain as a parameter of
qmckl_malloc, where the domain id is something obtained from the
context.

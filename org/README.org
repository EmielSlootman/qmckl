--------------------------------


  The ultimate goal of the QMCkl library is to provide a high-performance
  implementation  of  the main  kernels  of  QMC. In  this  particular
  implementation of the library, we focus on the definition of the API
  and the tests, and on a /pedagogical/ presentation of the
  algorithms.  We expect the HPC experts to use this repository as a
  reference for re-writing optimized libraries.

  The source code of the library is available at
  https://github.com/trex-coe/qmckl
  and bug reports should be submitted at
  https://github.com/trex-coe/qmckl/issues.

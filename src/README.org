Source files are written in org-mode format, to provide useful comments and
LaTex formulas around the code.

The code is extracted from the org files using Emacs in the `Makefile`, and
then he produced files are compiled.

For a better experience, editing can be done with Emacs. Note that Emacs can
behave like Vim when switched into ``Evil'' mode.

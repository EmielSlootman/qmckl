* QMCkl source code

** Introduction

Source files are written in org-mode format, to provide useful
comments and LaTex formulas close to the code. There exists multiple
possibilities to convert org-mode files into different formats such as
HTML or pdf.

The code is extracted from the org files using Emacs in the =Makefile=,
and then the produced files are compiled.

For a better experience, editing can be done with Emacs. Note that
Emacs can behave like Vim when switched into ``Evil'' mode.

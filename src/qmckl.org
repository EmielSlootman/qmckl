#+TITLE: Header files
#+SETUPFILE: ../docs/theme.setup

The =qmckl.h= header file has to be included in <<<C>>> codes when
QMCkl functions are used:

#+begin_src c  :tangle none
#include "qmckl.h"
#+end_src f90 


In <<<Fortran>>> programs, the =qmckl_f.f90= interface file should be
included in the source code using the library, and the Fortran codes
should use the ~qmckl~ module as

#+begin_src f90  :tangle none
use qmckl
#+end_src f90
